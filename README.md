# LingData

This is a simple collection of linguistic data sets. For now it only contains those data sets including in the NDL package http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ndl/index.html. I will include more data sets in the future.

To use simply do:

```
using LingData

dative = dataset("dative")
```


## Data sets included:

* danks
* dative
* lexample
* numbers
* plurals
* serbian
* serbianLex
* serbianUniCyr
* serbianUniLat
* think
